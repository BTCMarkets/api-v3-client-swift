# api-v3-client-swift

This application is a sample API client in SWift language that is only meant to demonstrate API authentication, placing, canceling, and listing orders. 

The client application is dependent on the CryptoSwift library to run. 

The entire project has been added here for simplicity and demonstration only and not necessarily as a model for developing Swift projects.
